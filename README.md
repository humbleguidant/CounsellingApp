Some of these tips include avoiding negative thinking, eating heatlthy foods, and so on. Users can create an account and access the content. The database stores user accounts such as the username, full name, and password. When the user logs in, they are given a main menu with eight options. Assertiveness, Balancing Emotional & Logical Thought, Body Scan, Challenging Negative Thoughts, Check In, Healthy Relationships, Managing Stress, and the 5 Minute Rule. If user forgot password, they can reset it on the login page.
